<pre>Welcome to the Land of Interpreted Languages!
If you are used to doing compiled languages this might be a shock... but if you hate assembly this is the place to be!

Unfortunately, if you hate Java, this may suck...
Good luck!

Let's try some hash cracking!! I'll go easy on you the first time. The first hash we are checking is this
	d5c67e2fc5f5f155dff8da4bdc914f41
Think you can crack it? If so give me the value that hashes to that!
	masterchief
Nice work! One down, two to go ...
This next one you don't get to see, if you aren't already digging into the class file you may wanna try that out!

Nice work! Here's the last one...
